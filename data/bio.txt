Lorenzo Maiuri is a software developer and AI engineer who combines deep technical expertise with a strong business-oriented mindset.
With a background in mathematics and a passion for scalable, intelligent systems, he has worked across projects spanning applied AI, data engineering, mobile, api, web, database full-stack development — always with a focus on solving real-world problems.
He specializes in natural language processing, LLM fine-tuning, and AI agents, and is particularly interested in designing autonomous, tool-using systems that are able to reason.
Lorenzo’s approach is pragmatic and impact-driven: he cares not only about how things work, but about why they matter to the people and businesses using them.
His journey into freelancing is the natural result of years spent building solutions across diverse personal, academic, and professional contexts — driven by curiosity, and refined through hands-on experience.
When not working on intelligent automation or building software, you might find him immersed in theater, enjoying literature, or drawing.
He’s currently based in Italy
